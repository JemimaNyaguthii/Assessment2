Here is a possible way to model Story, StoryTeller, and Translator objects:

class Story:
def init(self, title, author, language, length, moral_lessons, age_group):
self.title = title
self.author = author
self.language = language
self.length = length
self.moral_lessons = moral_lessons
self.age_group = age_group

Code snippet
def __repr__(self):
    return f"Story(title={self.title}, author={self.author}, language={self.language}, length={self.length}, moral_lessons={self.moral_lessons}, age_group={self.age_group})"

class Storyteller:
def init(self, name, language, age):
self.name = name
self.language = language
self.age = age

Code snippet
def __repr__(self):
    return f"Storyteller(name={self.name}, language={self.language}, age={self.age})"

class Translator:
def init(self, name, languages_known):
self.name = name
self.languages_known = languages_known

Code snippet
def translate(self, story, target_language):
    # TODO: Implement translation logic here.
    pass

def __repr=__(self):
    return f"Translator(name={self.name}, languages_known={self.languages_known})"

Inheritance can be used to model different types of stories and storytellers. For example, we could create a ChildrensStory class that inherits from Story and has an additional attribute called target_age_group. We could also create a ProfessionalStoryteller class that inherits from Storyteller and has an additional attribute called experience.

Here is an example of how inheritance could be used to model different types of stories:

class ChildrensStory(Story):
def init(self, title, author, language, length, moral_lessons, age_group):
super().init(title, author, language, length, moral_lessons, age_group)
self.target_age_group = age_group

Code snippet
def __repr__(self):
    return f"ChildrensStory(title={self.title}, author={self.author}, language={self.language}, length={self.length}, moral_lessons={self.moral_lessons}, age_group={self.age_group})"

Here is an example of how inheritance could be used to model different types of storytellers:

class ProfessionalStoryteller(Storyteller):
def init(self, name, language, age, experience):
super().init(name, language, age)
self.experience = experience

Code snippet
def __repr__(self):
    return f"ProfessionalStoryteller(name={self.name}, language={
